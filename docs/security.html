    <h1>Security — PR Gems</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 9, 2026</p>
    <p>Expi Labs takes the security of PR Gems seriously. This page describes our security practices and how to report vulnerabilities.</p>

    <h2>Our Practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local-first storage:</strong> Your workout data is stored locally on your device, reducing exposure to network-based threats.</li>
      <li><strong>Least privilege:</strong> The App requests only the permissions necessary for its features.</li>
      <li><strong>Secure communication:</strong> If the App communicates with external services (such as analytics or crash reporting), it uses HTTPS (TLS) to encrypt data in transit.</li>
      <li><strong>Platform security:</strong> We follow Android platform security best practices, including using the Android Keystore where appropriate and respecting the platform's sandboxing model.</li>
      <li><strong>Dependency management:</strong> We keep third-party libraries and dependencies up to date to address known vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Code review:</strong> All code changes are reviewed before release.</li>
    </ul>
