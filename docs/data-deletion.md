# Data Deletion — PR Gems

**Last updated:** February 9, 2026

We respect your right to control your data. This page explains how to request deletion of any data associated with your use of PR Gems.

## What Data Exists

PR Gems stores your workout data (exercises, weights, personal records) **locally on your device**. This data is not transmitted to our servers.

If analytics or crash-reporting services are enabled, limited technical data (device model, OS version, crash logs) may have been collected by third-party services. This data is typically anonymous and not linked to your identity.

## How to Delete Local Data

You can delete all local App data at any time by:

1. **Uninstalling the App** — this removes all locally stored data.
2. **Clearing App data** — go to your device's Settings > Apps > PR Gems > Storage > Clear Data.

## How to Request Deletion of Analytics or Crash Data

If you believe that analytics or crash-reporting data has been collected and you would like it deleted, please send a request to:

**Email:** expilabs7@gmail.com

**Subject line:** `Data Deletion Request — PR Gems`

Please include the following information:

- **Device model** (e.g., Pixel 7, Samsung Galaxy S24)
- **Android version** (e.g., Android 14)
- **App version** (if known)
- **Approximate date range** of usage (this helps us locate relevant data)

## What We Can and Cannot Delete

- **Local data:** Stored entirely on your device. Only you can delete it (see above).
- **Analytics/crash data:** If collected by third-party services, we will make reasonable efforts to request deletion on your behalf, subject to the capabilities and policies of those services.
- **Support correspondence:** If you've contacted us via email, you may request that we delete your support emails. Note that we may retain records as required by law.

## Timeline

We aim to acknowledge deletion requests promptly and will process them as quickly as reasonably possible. Processing time may vary depending on the third-party services involved.
