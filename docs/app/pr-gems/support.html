    <h3>The App crashed or is not responding</h3>
    <p>Try these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Close and reopen the App</strong> — swipe it away from your recent apps and relaunch.</li>
      <li><strong>Restart your device</strong> — a restart can resolve many transient issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Check for updates</strong> — make sure you're running the latest version from the Google Play Store.</li>

    <h3>Can I restore my data after uninstalling?</h3>
    <p>PR Gems stores your data locally on your device. If you uninstall the App without backing up your data, it cannot be recovered. We recommend exporting or backing up important data before uninstalling.</p>

    <h3>Does the App require an internet connection?</h3>
    <p>PR Gems is designed to work offline. An internet connection may be needed for certain features if they are enabled (such as crash reporting or checking for updates).</p>
