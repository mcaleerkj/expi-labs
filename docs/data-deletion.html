    <h1>Data Deletion — PR Gems</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 9, 2026</p>
    <p>We respect your right to control your data. This page explains how to request deletion of any data associated with your use of PR Gems.</p>

    <h2>What Data Exists</h2>
    <p>PR Gems stores your workout data (exercises, weights, personal records) <strong>locally on your device</strong>. This data is not transmitted to our servers.</p>
    <p>If analytics or crash-reporting services are enabled, limited technical data (device model, OS version, crash logs) may have been collected by third-party services. This data is typically anonymous and not linked to your identity.</p>

    <h2>How to Delete Local Data</h2>
    <p>You can delete all local App data at any time by:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Uninstalling the App</strong> — this removes all locally stored data.</li>
      <li><strong>Clearing App data</strong> — go to your device's Settings &gt; Apps &gt; PR Gems &gt; Storage &gt; Clear Data.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to Request Deletion of Analytics or Crash Data</h2>
    <p>If you believe that analytics or crash-reporting data has been collected and you would like it deleted, please send a request to:</p>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> expilabs7@gmail.com</p>
    <p><strong>Subject line:</strong> <code>Data Deletion Request — PR Gems</code></p>
    <p>Please include the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device model</strong> (e.g., Pixel 7, Samsung Galaxy S24)</li>
      <li><strong>Android version</strong> (e.g., Android 14)</li>
      <li><strong>App version</strong> (if known)</li>
      <li><strong>Approximate date range</strong> of usage (this helps us locate relevant data)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We Can and Cannot Delete</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local data:</strong> Stored entirely on your device. Only you can delete it (see above).</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics/crash data:</strong> If collected by third-party services, we will make reasonable efforts to request deletion on your behalf, subject to the capabilities and policies of those services.</li>
      <li><strong>Support correspondence:</strong> If you've contacted us via email, you may request that we delete your support emails. Note that we may retain records as required by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <p>We aim to acknowledge deletion requests promptly and will process them as quickly as reasonably possible. Processing time may vary depending on the third-party services involved.</p>
