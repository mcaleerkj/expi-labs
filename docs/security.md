# Security — PR Gems

**Last updated:** February 9, 2026

Expi Labs takes the security of PR Gems seriously. This page describes our security practices and how to report vulnerabilities.

## Our Practices

- **Local-first storage:** Your workout data is stored locally on your device, reducing exposure to network-based threats.
- **Least privilege:** The App requests only the permissions necessary for its features.
- **Secure communication:** If the App communicates with external services (such as analytics or crash reporting), it uses HTTPS (TLS) to encrypt data in transit.
- **Platform security:** We follow Android platform security best practices, including using the Android Keystore where appropriate and respecting the platform's sandboxing model.
- **Dependency management:** We keep third-party libraries and dependencies up to date to address known vulnerabilities.
- **Code review:** All code changes are reviewed before release.
