# Privacy Policy — PR Gems

**Last updated:** February 9, 2026

This privacy policy describes how Expi Labs ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with the PR Gems mobile application ("the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## 1. Information We Collect

PR Gems is designed to work without requiring personal information. Your workout data (exercises, weights, personal records) is stored **locally on your device** and is not transmitted to our servers.

**We do not collect:**
- Names, email addresses, or contact information (unless you contact us directly for support)
- Location data
- Photos, videos, or files from your device

**If enabled, the App may collect:**
- **Device and usage information:** If analytics or crash-reporting services are enabled, limited technical data (device model, operating system version, app version, crash logs) may be collected automatically. This data is used solely to improve app stability and performance.
- **Purchase information:** If in-app purchases are enabled, transactions are processed by the Google Play Store. We do not receive or store your payment details.

## 2. Permissions

The App may request certain device permissions to support its features. Each permission is used only for its stated purpose:

- Permissions are requested only when needed for a specific feature.
- You can manage permissions at any time through your device settings.
- Denying a permission may limit specific features but will not prevent the App from functioning overall.

## 3. Third-Party Services

If enabled, the App may use the following third-party services, each governed by their own privacy policies:

- **Google Play Services** — [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- **Firebase Analytics** (if enabled) — [Firebase Privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)
- **Firebase Crashlytics** (if enabled) — used to collect anonymous crash reports

These services may collect device identifiers, usage statistics, and crash data. We do not control the data practices of these third-party services and encourage you to review their policies.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information. We may share limited technical data only in the following circumstances:

- **With third-party service providers** (as described above) to operate and improve the App.
- **When required by law**, such as in response to a valid legal request.
- **To protect safety**, including to prevent fraud or address security issues.

## 5. Data Retention

- **Local data:** Your workout data is stored on your device and persists until you uninstall the App or clear its data.
- **Analytics and crash data** (if collected): Retained according to the third-party service provider's policies, typically for a limited period.

## 6. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect any data processed by the App, including using secure communication protocols and following platform security best practices. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 7. Children's Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information through the App, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

## 8. Your Choices

- **Uninstall:** You can delete all local App data by uninstalling the App.
- **Permissions:** You can revoke device permissions at any time through your device settings.
- **Analytics opt-out:** If analytics are enabled, you may be able to opt out through your device's advertising settings.
- **Data deletion request:** You can request deletion of any data associated with you by contacting us (see below).

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
